Gauss Legendre
==============

Table of nodes and weights upto 128th order. The tables are generated using mathematica to a very high precision.

The nodes are found inside the folder named 'nodes' and the weights are found in the folder named 'weights'.

For instance, the file 'nodes10' contains the Gauss Legendre nodes of order 10 and the file 'weights10' contains the corresponding weights. All the digits in these files are accurate.

C++ functions are also provided to obtain these values as an array of long double.
